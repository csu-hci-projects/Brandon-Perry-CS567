**Check Point 1**
I have:
  - Began to write the literature review of the final paper
  - Set up a simple shake-table to induced a know movement / displacement on an object which can then be measured with the DepthSense Cameras
  - Implemented some code. I created Two_Cameras_Center_Displacement.py which is a simple program to mesure movements and displacements of the center pixel using the Intel RealSense cameras
  - Created another code to track an area of pixels and measure the depth / displacement; this code is still a work in progress.
  
  Moving Forward:
  
  I plan:
  - to make the code more robust
  - to measure the accuracy and compare to the ground truth data
    
    
**Check Point 2:**
I have:
  - Collect Data to analyze including movements from a shake table, movements of a wire from induced excitation, and movements of a wire from an explosive blast collected using an RBG sensor on a UAV.
  - Created a program to measure displacements using an RGB camera with an idea to use only one sensor to capture 3D data
  
  Moveing Forward:
  
  I plan:
  - to measure the accuracy and compare to ground truth data
  - study feasibility of attaching sensor to UAV
  - Create User Friendly visualization of the out data
  
  
  **Check Point 3:**
I have:
  - Collected Data of a wire vibration induced from a blast.
  - Collected Accelerometer data to provide ground truth data to compare to the RealSense Sensor
  - Connected the RealSense Sensor to a UAV
  
  Moveing Forward:
  
  I plan:
  - compare accuracy of RealSense Sensor to the accelerometer data.
  - find a way to correct the movement of a UAV from the collected data of a wire vibration induced from blast
  
  
    **Check Point 4:**
I have:
  - Corrected the movement of a UAV from RGB Sensor data to find the ture movement of a wire's vibration induced from a blast
  
  Moveing Forward:
  
  I plan:
  - compare accuracy of RealSense Sensor to the accelerometer data.
  - design a user study to compare real-time data interpretation as opposed to post-process data using the data collected from the RealSense Sensor on the shake table.
  - begin to write final paper.
  
  
      **Check Point 5:**
I have:
  - Began to compose final paper
  - Wrote a program for the user-study
  - Compared RealSense Senor's calculated frequencies to accelerometer data to find less than 2% difference between the two
  
  Moveing Forward:
  
  I plan:
  - perform user-study
  - write final paper
  
  
       **Check Point 6:**
I have:
  - Interpret User-Study Data
  
  Moveing Forward:
  
  I plan:
  - assemble Final submittals for Project
