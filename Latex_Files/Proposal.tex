\begin{abstract}
  Fully understanding the bridge performance under traffic loadings is critical for improving bridge design, condition assessment, and load rating. Modern structural health monitoring (SHM) has enabled measurements of the traffic loads and dynamic bridge response to help enhance the knowledge on the mechanism of vehicle-bridge interactions; however, challenges still exist for accurately measuring the exact moving traffic loads and the corresponding traffic induced response. Recently, with the tremendous advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology (including better camera performance and longer flight times), UAVs can offer unique advantages to hover at specified heights and key locations and access difficult to reach areas and critical angles while providing relatively stable and high-quality imagery. By leveraging the recent advantages in UAV technologies, image computation, and camera vision-based SHM, this study proposes a UAV-based SHM system to track vehicular loading and measure the displacement of the bridge simultaneously. In the system, a UAV will hover adjacent to a bridge measuring the structure`s response. Then, an object identification algorithm will be developed to identify and track moving trucks. Digital image correlation technique will be employed to quantify the three-dimensional dynamic displacement of the bridge. Additionally, to facilitate adoption of the proposed system, a user-friendly interface will be developed to easily identify displacements of key 3D points.This proposed system will provide valuable data for accurate modeling and assessment of bridge performance under traffic loads.

\section{Project Overview, Timeline, and Deliverables}

The project will begin with first performing static testing of the equipment. \cite{Nguyen2017} has shown tremendous success using the same instrumentation within a static system with known, controlled variables. Replicating these results will be the first task. Next, the visualization of the information will be studied. The output from the system needs to provide a user-friendly interface to access and interpret the information. Lastly, if time permits, the tests will be performed using the same setup, but with the sensors installed on a UAV. The final deliverable will be the algorithm to measure 3D displacement of a structure using either the static, or dynamic setup of the equipment. Additionally, a user-friendly interface for a user to view and analyze the results will be built. This interface will include a 3D point cloud of the object as the object moves and some graphs and tables of the movement and results in real-time (if feasible).
