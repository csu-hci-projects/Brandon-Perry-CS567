# A Methodology for the Simultaneous Monitoring of Bridge Load and Induced 3-D Displacement using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Real-Time Data Interpretation User Study

**Overview of Project**

This project proposes a framework to measure the 3-D displacement of Bridge and create a full input-outout data acquistion model. A User-Study is also presented to decide the effacacy of providing real-time data to civil engineers in the field. The project is presented in four modules:

  1. A Truck Trakcing Module to follow a truck from a weigh-in-motion station on the United State's Interstate's Systems to a bridge of interest to provide the dynamic live loading of a bridge.
  2. A 2-D Planar Measurement Module using an optical RGB sensor attached to a UAV
  3. A 1-D Depth Measurement Module using an Intel RealSense D35 Sensor
  4. A User-Study Module to measure the efectiveness of providign real-time data to civil engineers in the field.
 
 The Python code for the four modules are located in the Source_Code Folder.
 
 Check Points for the semester are located in the Check_Points File.
 
 The Final Paper is given in the Writings Folder.

**Results**
|  | Correctness | Standard Deviation |
