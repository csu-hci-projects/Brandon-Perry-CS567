Check Point 1
I have:
  - Began to write the literature review of the final paper
  - Set up a simple shake-table to induced a know movement / displacement on an object which can then be measured with the DepthSense Cameras
  - Implemented some code. I created Two_Cameras_Center_Displacement.py which is a simple program to mesure movements and displacements of the center pixel using the Intel RealSense cameras
  - Created another code to track an area of pixels and measure the depth / displacement; this code is still a work in progress.
  
  Moving Forward:
  I plan:
    - to make the code more robust
    - to measure the accuracy and compare to the ground truth data
    
    
Check Point 2:
I have:
    - Collect Data to analyze including movements from a shake table, movements of a wire from induced excitation, and movements of a wire from an explosive blast collected using an RBG sensor on a UAV.
    - Created a program to measure displacements using an RGB camera with an idea to use only one sensor to capture 3D data
Moveing Forward:
I plan:
    - to measure the accuracy and compare to ground truth data
    - study feasibility of attaching sensor to UAV
    - Create User Friendly visualization of the out data
